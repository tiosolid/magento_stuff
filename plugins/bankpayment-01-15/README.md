# Bank Payment - Payment Plugin

This is a modified version of the Bank Payment plugin by [Phoenix Media](https://www.phoenix-media.eu/).

I added some new functionality to make the plugin more fit for the Brazilian market. 
In Brazil we are used to buying something online, transfering the money to the designated account and then going to the store website to "confirm" the payment (inputing some data like day / time of payment, total value, etc). This mod adds this new functionality (and overrides some default templates for that) and some new fields in the bank account data in the administration panel.

The plugin will also send an email to the store admin when a new payment is confirmed.

This plugin is Magento 1 compatible.
